# TIFANY

TIFANY is a small single-page web application composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The repository contains the UI, styles, and client-side logic for the project. It is intended to be run as a static web app (open the HTML file in a browser or serve the folder from any static file server).

## Features

- Lightweight, dependency-free front-end implementation
- Single-file HTML entrypoint with separate CSS and JS
- Easy to run locally or deploy to any static hosting service

## File structure

- tifany.html  — Main HTML page / UI
- tifany.css   — Styles for the application
- tifany.js    — Client-side JavaScript logic

## Getting started

Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Optional: a simple static file server for development (live-server, http-server, Python's http.server, etc.)

Run locally
1. Open `tifany.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file), or
2. Serve the project folder from a static server and open the served URL in your browser. Example using Python 3 from the project folder:

   python -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000/tifany.html

Development
- Edit `tifany.html`, `tifany.css`, and `tifany.js` as needed.
- If you use a development server with live reload, changes will be visible immediately in the browser.

Contributing
- Contributions are welcome. Please open issues or pull requests with clear descriptions of changes.
